##Project Description
This is a learning webpage that allows users to enter three dimensions of a triangle and checks whether the triangle is equilateral,isoscles,scalene or not a triangle ,It does not allow users to input non-numerical value.It's is areally useful webpage for learners.
##Installations
###Requirements
- internet connection
- VS code/atom
- google chrome browser
###Technologies used
+ HTML
+ CSS
+ Javascript
+ Bootstrap
+ Markdown syntax 
##BDDProgram Behaviour
The program should output this when the user inputs  a negative dimension or a zero dimension:
user input: first dimension = -1, second dimension = 0, third dimension = 0

Output :  valid dimension

The program should output this when thr user inputs the sum of any  two dimension  is less than or equal to the third dimension:
User input: first dimension = 1, second dimension = 1, third dimension = 3

Output : Not a triangle

The program should output this when user inputs all  dimensions that are equal:
 User input : first dimension = 4, second dimension = 4, third dimension = 4

Output : Equilateral:All sides are equal

The program should output this when the user inputs at most two sides  that are equal:
user input: first side = 4, second side = 4, third side = 5

Output : Isosceles:Two sides are equal!

The program should output this when all sides are not equal:
User input: first dimension = 4, second dimension = 5, third dimension = 6

Output :Scalene triangle:No sides are equal
