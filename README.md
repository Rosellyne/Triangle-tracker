##Project Description
This is a learning webpage that allows users to enter three dimensions of a triangle and checks whether the triangle is equilateral,isoscles,scalene or not a triangle ,It does not allow users to input non-numerical value.It's is areally useful webpage for learners.

##BDDProgram Behaviour
Behaviour	Input Example	Output Example
User doesn't type anything	,,	Please FILL all the fields
User fills only one field	4,,	Please FILL all the fields
User fills two fields	4,4,	Please FILL all the fields
User enters three sides not equal	4,5,3	That is a SCALENE triangle
User enters two equal sides	4,4,5	That is an ISOSCELES triangle
User enters three equal sides	4,4,4	That is an EQUILATERAL triangle
When the sum of any two sides > third side	7,7,5	That is NOT a triangle
When the user doesn't enter a number	"the", 2,4	That is NOT a number
Input Example: a

Output Example: Please enter a valid dimension

The program should return this when the input is a negative value:
Input Example: -1

Output Example: Please enter a valid dimension

The program should return this when the sum of any two sides is less than or equal to the third side:
Input Example: first side = 1, second side = 1, third side = 3

Output Example: It's not a triangle

The program should return this when all sides are equal:
Input Example: first side = 4, second side = 4, third side = 4

Output Example: It's an equilateral triangle

The program should return this when at most two sides are equal:
Input Example: first side = 4, second side = 4, third side = 5

Output Example: It's an isosceles triangle

The program should return this when all sides are not equal:
Input Example: first side = 4, second side = 5, third side = 6

Output Example: It's an scalene triangle
